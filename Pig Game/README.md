This is a Pig Game, and I have coded this thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course. The rules of the game are very simple.

There are two players in this game.
------------------------------------
Player 1 will start the game and roll the die, using the ROLL button. Whatever number the die lands on will be added to the current score.
This will keep adding up. However, if the player rolls a one, then their current "streak" will be lost, and the players will switch.
This is essentially a luck based game. If you think you've risked enough, you can click the HOLD button to 
transfer the current score to your total score, located above it it bigger font. However, holding your number will switch the player.
If a player makes then total score 100 or greater, then they have won the game! Click the NEW GAME button and you can restart.
------------------------------------
This is the game in its entirety. To play the game, download the ZIP and just open the index.html file.

Thank you for coming here and I hope you enjoy!
